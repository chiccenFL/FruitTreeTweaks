chiccen's Updated Fruit Tree Tweaks For 1.6

Original mod by aedenthorn

==========================

This update doesn't change much from the original mod, just updated a couple lines to code to make it current with 1.6
Some features that broke with 1.6 are still missing and being worked on. This update is a WIP, and those features will return eventually.
If I broke something, let me know. I don't actually intend to use the mod myself so I won't know if there are minor bugs.
If reporting a bug on Nexus, PLEASE use the "Bug Report" tab and NOT "Posts" unless it is an extremely minor bug you want to point out.

==========================


Reqires most recent version of SMAPI
Requires Generic Mod Config Menu (GMCM) as default values are all vanilla

If you have further questions, you can reach me on Discord @chiccen


I will take this mod down at the request of aedenthorn
