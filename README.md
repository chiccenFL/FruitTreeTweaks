## chiccen's Updated Fruit Tree Tweeks For 1.6 

##### [Original mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11422) created by [aedenthorn](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/aedenthorn/about-me)

This update doesn't change much from the original, it primarily brings the mod up to date with Stardew Valley version 1.6.  
Some features that broke with 1.6 are still missing and being worked on. This update is a work in progress, and those features will return eventually.  
If I broke something, let me know by submitting a bug report or reaching on Discord (@chiccen). You are also free to contribute to the [Github](https://github.com/chiccenFL/FruitTreeTweaks/tree/main).  
If making a bug report on Nexus, please use the ["Bugs"](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21449/?tab=bugs) tab and ***not*** "Posts" unless it is a suggestion, a mod conflict, or a very very minor bug.
